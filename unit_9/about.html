				<p> My name is Jasmine and I'm a 19yr old artist from California. Art is something that I'm very passionate about and want to share with everyone. For me art is a way of exploring my inner self and a way to express my love for animals. Art is what opens the door into the artist's world. Since I'm self taught, I'm constantly learning new techniques and evolving in style. Though I occasionally draw humans and other things. My favorite subjects to draw are animals like; horses, rabbits, tigers, and whales. So you will see pieces that revolve around those animals. I hope you enjoy the art I have posted on my website. Please visit my instagram @noodles_art for more art.   </p>
