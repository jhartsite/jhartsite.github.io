				<p> My name is Jasmine and I'm a 19yr old artist from California. Art is something that I'm very passionate about and want to share with everyone. For me art is a way of exploring my inner self and a way to express my love for animals. Art is what opens the door into the artist's world. Since I'm self taught, I'm constantly learning new techniques and evolving in style. Though I occasionally draw humans and other things. My favorite subjects to draw are animals like; horses, rabbits, tigers, and whales. So you will see pieces that revolve around those animals. I'm also quite passionate about learning new things because there isn't a day when one stops learning. When I'm not drawing, I'm spending time with my rabbits. Rabbits hold a special place in my heart. Those are just a few things about me but I feel it is important to know who is behind a piece art.   </p>
