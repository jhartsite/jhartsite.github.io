				<p> My name is Jasmine and I'm a 19yr old artist. Art is something that I'm very passionate about and want to share with everyone. For me art is a way of exploring my inner self and a way to express my love for animals. Since I'm self taught, I'm constantly learning new techniques and evolving in style. I use art as a way to appreciate the beauty of the natural world. My subject matter is mainly focused on animals. Though I occasionally draw humans and other things. My favorite animals to draw are horses,rabbits,tigers,and whales. So you will see pieces that revolve around those animals. When I'm not drawing, I'm spending time with my pet rabbits. </p>
